# FashionMNIST_resnet18
#### using resnet18 to learning on MNIST data 
 - 10 classes 
 - run the code will downloading the resnet18 network and the MNIST data.  
 - calaculate the loss by CrossEntropyLoss.  
 - train function will train the network.
 - test function will test the network the output will be the loss value and accuracy value
 - in the end you will see the Graf about loss during the train and test 
    and the Accuracy value in each epoch we run 

you can see the conv file that i build a network 
class name is Net using conv and fc method
