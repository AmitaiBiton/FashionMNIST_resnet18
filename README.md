using resnet18 to learning on MNIST data 
have 10 classes 
run the code will downloading the resnet18 network and the MNIST data


calaculate the loss by CrossEntropyLoss function 

train function will train the network on this data you can decide to learn on all the data or part 

test function will test the network output will be the loss value and accuracy 


in the end you will see the Graf about loss during the train and test 
and the Accuracy value in each epoch we run 

yoy can see the conv file that i build network 
class name is Net using conv and fc method
